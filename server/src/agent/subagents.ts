 * Specialized sub-agent roster for scientific work.

 * This is the seed source for the per-project agent files consumed by the

 * `sandbox/.pi/agents/<name>.md` (YAML frontmatter + system prompt) where the
 * package's project-agent discovery picks them up. Files are written only
 * when missing, so users can tune or replace any agent from the file panel.
 * The persona is appended to the subagent's system prompt on top of the
 * normal sandbox context (AGENTS.md etc.), so every sub-agent keeps the same
 * working directory — only its focus, standards, and output contract change.
 *
 * Personas share a few conventions:
 * - Reviewers report findings ordered by severity and cite file:line or the
 *   exact claim they checked; they do not silently fix things.
 * - Researchers/writers state uncertainty explicitly rather than guessing.
 * - Builders (pipeline, visualization) verify their output runs before
 *   reporting success.
