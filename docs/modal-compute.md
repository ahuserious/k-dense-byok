# Durable Modal compute

K-Dense BYOK can offload expensive commands to isolated
[Modal](https://modal.com) CPU and GPU sandboxes while the local project
sandbox remains the source of truth. Modal jobs are project-scoped, persisted
on disk, metered against the project budget, and visible in the **Compute** tab.

## Configure Modal

Open **Settings → API keys** and save the Modal token ID and token secret as a
pair. K-Dense validates the pair before marking the connection ready. Existing
chat tabs pick up credential changes without a restart.

Modal credentials stay in the repo-root `.env` file on the local machine. They
authenticate K-Dense to Modal but are not copied into remote sandboxes.

## Pick compute

The compute picker reads its resource catalogue from the backend. It includes
CPU presets and single- or multi-GPU options, depending on what Modal makes
available to the account. The selected resource is the chat's default; a tool
call can request another supported resource when the task requires it.

Rates shown in K-Dense are estimates. Modal bills sandboxes by their requested
or actual resources and elapsed time, and does not expose a generally available
per-sandbox invoice API. The job detail therefore labels compute amounts as
estimated rather than exact.

## Agent tools

The lead agent and sub-agents share the same project job service:

- `modal_run` submits a short job and waits for it. Stopping the chat turn
  cancels this blocking job.
- `modal_submit` starts a durable background job and returns its job id.
- `modal_status` reads a job's current state and recent logs.
- `modal_wait` waits for a bounded period for a job to finish.
- `modal_cancel` cancels a job explicitly.
- `modal_results` collects or reports a completed job's outputs.
- `modal_submit_batch` submits a bounded group of independent jobs.

Background jobs intentionally survive the chat turn that created them. They
continue until completion, explicit cancellation, timeout, or project deletion.

## Job lifecycle and recovery

A job moves through these durable states:

```
queued → preparing → running → collecting → succeeded
                                      └──→ failed
queued/preparing/running/collecting ──→ cancelled
```

K-Dense writes job state, transitions, and bounded stdout/stderr logs under:

```
sandbox/.kady/modal/jobs/<jobId>/
```

Each remote sandbox is named and tagged with its K-Dense job id. If the backend
restarts, it scans non-terminal records, reconnects to surviving sandboxes, and
resumes monitoring or collection. A remote sandbox that can no longer be found
is marked `lost`, its budget reservation is reconciled, and the failure remains
visible in job history.

## Files and outputs

Inputs are validated before a remote sandbox is created:

- paths must remain inside the project sandbox;
- missing inputs fail immediately;
- directories are enumerated recursively;
- escaping symlinks and excessive transfer sizes are rejected;
- transferred files receive integrity checksums.

Remote outputs are downloaded into a local temporary directory and validated
before being installed atomically at their requested sandbox paths. Output
patterns are bounded, and job details distinguish missing files from transfer,
permission, size, and other I/O errors.

The local project remains canonical. Modal Volumes are used only for optional
per-project dependency, model, and reference-data caches. Named environment
snapshots can reuse an installed environment without turning the remote
filesystem into a second project workspace.

## Logs and job controls

The center-panel **Compute** tab shows all jobs for the project, including:

- lifecycle and current phase;
- requested and resolved resources;
- live stdout and stderr tails;
- elapsed time and estimated spent/reserved cost;
- input and output transfer manifests;
- failure details;
- cancel, retry, collect, and open-output actions.

Logs are persisted with a size cap so a noisy process cannot consume unlimited
local disk or model context. Tool results still contain a compact tail and link
back to the complete retained job record.

## Budgets and reservations

Before creating Modal resources, K-Dense reserves the job's worst-case estimate:

```
estimated hourly rate × requested timeout
```

Admission is blocked when settled project spend plus open reservations plus the
new reservation would exceed the hard project cap. On every terminal path—
success, non-zero exit, failure, cancellation, timeout, or recovery loss—the
reservation is settled to estimated elapsed spend and unused headroom is
released.

The cost UI distinguishes:

- **spent**: settled model and compute estimates;
- **reserved**: worst-case holds for active Modal jobs;
- **committed**: spent plus reserved.

Historical compute rows remain valid and require no migration.

## Current boundaries

- Multi-GPU jobs run within one Modal sandbox; multi-node distributed training
  is not orchestrated yet.
- Cost is an estimate, not reconciliation against Modal's final invoice.
- Network egress policy and per-job secret injection are separate security
  improvements.
- Transfer checksums protect integrity but are not a complete scientific
  provenance system.

## Developer verification

Normal backend tests use an injected fake Modal adapter and never contact the
service. With a configured token pair, run the opt-in real CPU smoke test with:

```bash
cd server
set -a; source ../.env; set +a
MODAL_LIVE_TEST=1 npm test -- test/modal-live.test.ts
```

The test creates a short CPU sandbox, transfers one input and output, verifies
the returned artifact, reconciles estimated cost, and then cleans up.


## The Modal command-line tool

Modal also publishes a `modal` command-line program. K-Dense does **not** use it to run jobs — job
submission, monitoring, cancellation, file transfer and cost accounting all go through the built-in
integration described above, which is durable and metered. A second way to start a job would just be
a second way to get it wrong.

What the CLI is used for is the two things the built-in path cannot tell you:

- **whether the `modal` program is installed on this machine, and at what version**;
- **which Modal workspace your configured tokens belong to** — useful if you have more than one Modal
  account and want to know which one a job will bill to.

**Settings → Connectors → Known integrations → Modal** reports both, on two lines:

- `CLI: found at <path> (<version>)`, or `CLI: not found — …`;
- `Workspace: <what "modal profile current" printed>`, or `Workspace: unavailable — <reason>` when
  Modal is not configured, the program is not installed, or the command failed.

Nothing else stops working when the program is missing, because nothing else depends on it. The
workspace text is the CLI's own output, unparsed — its format is not pinned across CLI versions, and
parsing it would be inventing a contract.

Both readings run only when that panel asks for them (`GET /integrations/modal/cli`), never while the
connector list is merely being listed, and the version reading is reused for five minutes rather than
re-run on every visit.

The CLI reuses the credentials you already saved in **Settings → API keys**. There is no second place
to enter a Modal token, and there is no second environment variable. The credentials are passed to the
program through its environment, never on its command line, so they cannot be read out of a process
listing. The invariant above still holds: they are not copied into remote sandboxes.

Only two read-only subcommands are ever run (`--version` and `profile current`). K-Dense does not pass
anything you type to the `modal` program.
